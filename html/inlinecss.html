      A web developer is a programmer who specializes in the development of
      websites and web applications. They are responsible for designing, coding,
      and maintaining websites to ensure they function properly and provide a
      positive user experience.<br />
      Web developers use a variety of programming languages and tools to create
      websites, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks and
      libraries. They also work closely with designers and other team members to
      bring a website to life.

    <p style="color: rgb(90, 90, 23); font-family: cursive;">There are three <del>3</del> types of developers.</p>
    <ol>
      <li style="color: rgb(85, 53, 6); font-family: cursive;">Front-end developer</li>
      <li style="color: rgb(81, 54, 15); font-family: cursive;">Back-ned developer</li>
      <li style="color: rgb(76, 52, 15);font-family: cursive;">Full-stack developer</li>
    </ol>
    <h6 style="color: rgb(10, 27, 61); background-color: rgb(126, 167, 203); width: 200px;font-size: large;">1.Front-end Developers</h6>
    <p style="color: rgb(96, 19, 124);">
      Front-end developers are responsible for creating the visible parts of a
      website or web application that users interact with directly. They focus
      on the client-side of development, working with technologies such as HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement user interfaces. Front-end
      developers ensure that web pages are visually appealing, responsive, and
      functional across different devices and browsers. They often collaborate
      closely with UI/UX designers to bring design concepts to life and optimize
      user experiences.
    </p>
    <h6 style="color: rgb(24, 5, 42); background-color: rgb(227, 71, 71); width: 200px;font-size: large;">Back-end Developers</h6>
    <p style="color: rgb(53, 7, 95);">
      Back-end developers focus on the server-side of web development, dealing
      with the behind-the-scenes logic and functionality that power websites and
      web applications. They work with server-side programming languages (e.g.,
      Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js) and frameworks to build and maintain the
      server, database, and application logic. Back-end developers handle tasks
      such as data management, authentication, server configuration, and API
      development. They ensure that the application works smoothly, securely,
      and efficiently, often collaborating with front-end developers to
      integrate server-side functionality with the user interface.
    </p>
    <h6 style="color: rgb(4, 4, 56); background-color: aquamarine; width: 200px;font-size: large;">Full-stack Developers</h6>
    <p style="color: rgb(58, 4, 4); background-color: rgb(235, 99, 99);">
      Full-stack developers possess proficiency in both front-end and back-end
      development, allowing them to work on all aspects of web development, from
      the client-side to the server-side. They have a broad skill set that
      enables them to design, develop, and deploy complete web applications
      independently or as part of a team. Full-stack developers are adept at
      working with a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools
      across the entire web development stack. They have a comprehensive
      understanding of how the front-end and back-end components interact and
      can effectively troubleshoot and optimize the entire application.
